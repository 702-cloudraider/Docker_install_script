## Docker installaton script

I wanted to make a quick installation script since I tend to forget certain things while installing docker onto my machine

Keep in mind that this script uses your local machines name so if you want to use something else edit it out and insert the name that you want in place of mine. 

Also remember that the full script will not intiially run all the way through since you need to exit first so that your installations can take place

Just re-run the script and enjoy. 

### Don't forget 

name your script whatever you like ie (docker_install.sh)

Make it executable chmod +x (docker_install.sh)

Then run the command ./install_docker.sh

## install repo

sudo (yum or dnf) install git

git clone <repository_url>

cd (example-repo)
